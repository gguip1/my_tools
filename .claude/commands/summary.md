Analyze the current project and generate (or update) a `PROJECT.md` file at the project root.

This document is for humans to copy-paste and share, not for Claude context.

## What to include

1. **Project Overview**: What this project does (1-2 sentences)
2. **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, key dependencies
3. **Directory Structure**: Main directories and their purposes
4. **Getting Started**: How to install, run, build
5. **Usage Examples**: If applicable

## Rules

- Be concise and scannable.
- If `PROJECT.md` already exists, update it. Preserve manual additions.
- Use Korean.
- Skip sections that are unclear or not discoverable.
- After generating, show a brief summary of what was added/updated.
